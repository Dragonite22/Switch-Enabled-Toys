## About the Project

The project focuses on creating switch-enabled toys for students of Rainbow Centre with multiple disabilities.
Due to their limited mobility, they are only able to watch from the sidelines as their peers engage in physical activities. 
We are currently working on a remote-controlled device that can be controlled by wheelchair-bound students to launch a ball into a net 
just by pressing a few buttons. We hope that with this device, they can engage more meaningfully in sports, 
and learn about directional changes as well as cause and effect.
